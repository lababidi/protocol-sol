## 💡 Key Concepts (Quick Version)

### Dual-Token Model
Every option creates **TWO tokens**:
- **Option Token**: Exercise right (pre-expiry)
- **Redemption Token**: Vault claim (post-expiry)

### 5 Core Operations
1. `create_option_series` - Initialize market
2. `mint_options` - Deposit collateral, get tokens
3. `exercise_option` - Pay strike, get underlying
4. `redeem` - Get pro-rata vault share
5. `burn_paired_tokens` - 1:1 refund anytime

### Security
- PDA vaults (no private keys)
- Full collateralization (1:1)
- Multiple validation layers
- Checked arithmetic
- Token-2022 compatible
