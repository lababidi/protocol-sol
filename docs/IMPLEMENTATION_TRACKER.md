## Implementation Log

### Session 1: Setup
- Created TICKET-SOL-OPT-001-greek-fi-compliance.md
- Created IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md
- Ready to begin implementation

### Session 2: Full Implementation - Greek.fi Compliance
- Added `is_put: bool` field to OptionSeries (option_series.rs:20)
- Added `total_consideration_withdrawn: u64` field to OptionSeries (option_series.rs:23)
- Updated OptionSeries::LEN from 237 to 246 bytes (option_series.rs:67-68)
- Created ConsiderationClaim account structure (consideration_claim.rs)
  - Includes option_series, user, amount_withdrawn, bump fields
  - LEN = 81 bytes, PDA seeds: ["consideration_claim", option_series, user]
- Updated state/mod.rs to export ConsiderationClaim
- Updated create_option_series instruction (lib.rs, create_series.rs)
  - Added is_put parameter to function signature
  - Initialize is_put and total_consideration_withdrawn in handler
- Added 5 new error codes (NoShortTokens, NoCashAvailable, etc.)
- Created initialize_consideration_claim instruction
  - Initializes ConsiderationClaim PDA for user tracking
- Created redeem_consideration instruction (CRITICAL FEATURE)
  - Pro-rata consideration claiming for SHORT holders before expiry
  - Formula: user_share = (cash_vault × user_shorts) / total_supply
  - Proper validation, checked math, and state tracking
- Updated instructions/mod.rs to export new instructions
- Registered new instructions in lib.rs (initialize_consideration_claim, redeem_consideration)
- Deleted deprecated deposit.rs file
- Ran `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `anchor build` - all passed ✅
- Updated all test files with is_put parameter:
  - sol_option_protocol.ts
  - simple_test.ts
  - integration_testnet.ts
- ✅ Acceptance criteria #1-11, #15-17 complete

**Key Features Implemented:**
1. ✅ State tracking for put/call options (is_put field)
2. ✅ ConsiderationClaim PDA for per-user tracking
3. ✅ **Critical: redeemConsideration() - Capital efficiency for option writers**
   - SHORT holders can now claim pro-rata consideration BEFORE expiry
   - Enables immediate access to strike payments from exercises
   - Proper checked math and overflow protection
4. ✅ All error codes for validation
5. ✅ Full Anchor build passes
6. ✅ All existing tests updated

### Session 3: Greek.fi Compliance Testing Suite
- Fixed deserialization in all phase test files (phase2-5)
  - Added `isPut` field deserialization (1 byte at offset after expiration)
  - Added `totalConsiderationWithdrawn` deserialization (8 bytes at offset after isPut)
  - Updated return statements to include new fields
- Created comprehensive `greek_fi_compliance.ts` test file
  - Test 1: Create call option series (is_put = false)
  - Test 2: Two writers mint options (create SHORT positions)
  - Test 3: Initialize consideration claims for writers
  - Test 4: Buyer exercises options, creating consideration in cash vault
  - Test 5: Writer1 redeems consideration BEFORE expiry (Greek.fi capital efficiency)
  - Test 6: Double-claim protection test
  - Test 7: Incremental claims after additional exercises
- Added `test:greek-fi` script to package.json
- Ran Prettier on all test files - all passed ✅
- **Note:** Tests ready for testnet execution but not yet run (requires deployed program)

**Testing Infrastructure Complete:**
- ✅ All test files updated with new state fields
- ✅ Comprehensive Greek.fi compliance test suite created (7 test scenarios)
- ✅ All tests follow existing patterns and formatting standards
- ✅ Test scripts configured in package.json
- ⏳ Ready for testnet execution when program is deployed
